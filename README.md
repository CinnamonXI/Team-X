## Problem Statement
Access to healthcare information and support is limited, particularly for people with different health conditions. Existing healthcare services are often costly and not easily accessible, and there is a lack of community support and information-sharing among people with similar health conditions. This creates a significant burden for patients and their families, leading to a lack of knowledge and understanding about health conditions and treatments, and increased isolation.

## Proposed Solution
To address the problem of access to primary healthcare, we propose building a health forum website that provides a platform for people to connect, share information, and support each other. The health forum will be designed to cater to people with different health conditions and will offer a range of features such as discussion boards, user profiles, search functionality, notifications, moderation tools, resource library, private messaging, multi-language support, and accessibility features. The website will be user-friendly, visually appealing, and accessible to users of all levels of technical skill and abilities. By creating a community of people with shared experiences, the health forum will help to reduce the burden of health conditions, improve access to healthcare information and support, and increase social connections and well-being.
